git clone https://github.com/fred001/frd-php-framework.git

### if ###
#you are new of frd framework,and just want understand how it works
#then you can only set your web server with the documentroot dir: SOURCE/public

      then you should change the local db setting which in file: SOURCE/local/setting.php

### else if ###

#you already understand it ,and want use it for your own project
#then after clone the repo,you should delete all unnecessary files for your project

        these files include  
        SOURCE/
          test
          README.md
          .git

        and also need setup your own local db setting (SOURCE/local/setting.php)

        the script  SOURCE/install.py can help config db and remove files
        run it by:
